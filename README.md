# Comprehensive-Analysis-of-User-Activity

## Executive Summary

This project analyzed how people use GitHub, a popular platform for sharing and collaborating on code. We looked at when people were most active, which programming languages they used most, the types of licenses they preferred for their projects, the most popular technologies, and how often the Big Five tech companies (Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta) were mentioned.

## Methodology

The project also utilized Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for its robust computing capabilities. GCP provided the necessary infrastructure to handle the large volume of data from GitHub repositories and perform complex computations required for the analysis.

The findings are based on a comprehensive examination of GitHub user activity, programming language usage, and technology trends between 2020 and 2022. The methodology ensured a rigorous and systematic approach to uncovering insights about the GitHub ecosystem.

## Source Data

The source data for the project was gathered from a wide array of GitHub repositories. These repositories encompassed a diverse range of topics, including programming, technology, and open-source contributions. The data from these repositories provided a comprehensive view of GitHub user activity, programming language usage, and technology trends between 2020 and 2022. This wide-ranging data set served as the foundation for the project's analysis and findings, offering valuable insights into the GitHub ecosystem
